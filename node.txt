nce you’ve got your pipeline stages set up, how do you ensure it’s a success? How do you challenge any of the blockers or push-back that you might get?

It’s difficult implementing a full end-to-end pipeline, especially if you’re used to working in the traditional way of manually packaging software and passing it between different teams. You might get a lot of pushback.

So here are three things I make sure to do, to ensure the pipeline is a success:

Invest in writing tests: Some people are sceptical about CI/CD, because they think there’s a chance that your software will go into production with bugs. This is of course a risk. You can minimise it by ensuring you have a proper suite of unit tests and acceptance tests.

Make it easy to execute: Even the most well-designed pipeline will struggle to gain traction if it’s difficult to run, or perhaps if it can only be run by people with the right permissions. Set up a trigger to ensure that your pipeline runs automatically on every single commit.

Keep credentials safe: Some teams fear that a CI/CD pipeline means sharing “the keys to the kingdom”, by giving out test or production server credentials. Sure, there are some risks, and you don’t want your pipeline to be compromised! So read the documentation for your CI/CD tool thoroughly, observe any security settings they recommend, and don’t leave passwords anywhere where they could be found.
